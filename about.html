            Public health researchers have called food allergies “a growing
            public health epidemic in Canada” affecting around one in 13
            Canadians and one in five Canadian households. Dining out can be
            risky and stressful for people with allergies, in part because many
            restaurant employees lack the training, skills and confidence to
            manage food allergies safely and effectively. These are challenges
            that existed before the COVID-19 pandemic and will surely persist
            after it. In recent years, news outlets across Canada have reported
            several cases of people suffering extreme, sometimes fatal, allergic
            reactions to restaurant food. Accidents like these are most often
            due to miscommunication. As researchers in the field of
            industrial-organizational psychology, we analyzed how and why
            information about food allergies gets communicated, and
            miscommunicated, at restaurants. We approached allergy communication
            the way we might approach communication among a flight crew or a
            surgical team: by isolating the make-or-break behaviours in the
            communication process. Based on this research, we offer some
            guidelines to reduce the risk of allergic reactions at restaurants
            and improve the customer experience.

          <h2>Customer-Representative:</h2>
          <p>
            In its July 2014 issue, Time Magazine ranked the San Francisco Bay
            Area the second healthiest place to live in America. Crediting it as
            the "birthplace of farm-to-table" dining, the story provides a
            compelling portrayal of the Bay Area as a healthy foodie's heaven.
            Indeed, this area has a special focus on real food, sustainable and
            seasonal farming, and support for local agriculture. Bringing this
            proud characteristic of San Francisco's food scene to the forefront
            are three restaurants that offer menus that undeniably emphasize
            nutrition and real ingredients, while also maintaining reasonable
            prices. The subtle Mission storefront and minimalist white wall make
            Green Heart Foods an easy target to miss. Seating is (very) limited,
            but what this cafe lacks in strong presence, it more than makes up
            for in fresh, healthy food offerings. GHF has options for every kind
            of healthy foodie. For macrobiotic eaters, there are whole grain,
            veggie bowls and hearty salads. If you're gluten-free, you'll love
            the breakfast (or lunch) Superhero Bowl. If you're vegetarian, or
            strictly vegan, GHF offers three different raw breakfast bowls and
            vegan muffins. Their popular blue plate specials, which change daily
            and typically includes a hearty dish of vegetables, complex carbs,
            and healthy starches, keep the menu fresh and interesting. This
            place is a gem for breakfast and lunch, open everyday from 8-3. By 3
            pm, most dishes have sold out, and the raw, vegan cookie jars sit
            empty. GHF may easy to miss, but after one visit, you will be a
            regular.
